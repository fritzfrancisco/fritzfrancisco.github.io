Beginning my academic training in classical biology I transitioned through the fields of marine biology, behavioural biology and informatics. I have recently taken up a interdisciplinary doctoral position at the Humbold University in Berlin working with [Pawel Romanczuk](http://lab.romanczuk.de/) as part of the [Science of Intelligence Excellence Cluster](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/). My current work focuses on the computational implementations for analysing fish behaviour in the wild. This is done with software written in the programming language Python and utilizing the OpenCV package in order to achieve high throughput video analysis.

Personally my interests revolve around aquatic systems, as I have always been driven towards water and anything that may inhabit these intricate ecosystems. However, bridging across all natural systems are the complex interactions and mechanisms governing a single organism, groups of animals, or even our societies. I want to shed light on these underlying rules in order to add to a more holistic view on the world and what surrounds us. Learning from such complex systems we can potentially transfer this knowledge to various fields of research, ranging from artificial intelligence and optimization algorithms to socioeconomic implementations such as electoral outcomes and crowd control.
